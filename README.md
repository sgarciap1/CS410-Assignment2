Each team member also contributed to the 3 extra gameplay elements/effects.

Uses of effects:

Dot product: We used the dot product by accurately changing the angle of the gargoyles' radius, so they make more sense with the cone shape of the red flash lights if you are caught.

Linear interpolation: We used this gameplay element to help us add a sprinting effect when you press the left shift key.

Particle effect: We used this effect by combining the use of our linear interpolation by creating a orange fiery trail when pressing the shift (sprint) key.
